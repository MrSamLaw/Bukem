## Description

Bukem is a simple search engine utilising the Google Books API, allowing users to save books.

## What We Did

We were provided with a working (front and back-end) site built with a RESTful API. This was refactored to be a GraphQL API, using Apollo Server utilising typeDefs, resolvers, queries & mutations.
